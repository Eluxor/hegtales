His brow raises slightly, but he doesn’t question your decision. With a small nod, he gestures for you to follow, leading you inside the grand halls of Ossum Castle. There is a huge contrast, the laughter and playful chatter of children echo through the corridors. They dart past, their carefree energy a stark juxtaposition to the heavy air surrounding the ceremony.

The procession moves deeper into the castle, its path deliberate and unhurried. Finally, it comes to a halt in a vast hall. The space is grand yet somber, its vaulted ceilings adorned with banners bearing the Ossum family crest and Hegemony flags, you even notice the flag of the Dominion.

Without a word, he extends his hand, and you meet it with a firm handshake.

The ceremony honoring Admiral Christian Ossum is a grand affair, attended by members of numerous noble houses. Among them is the increasingly influential House Rao. The great hall is filled with quiet murmurs of condolences and speeches extolling the Admiral's virtues, his dedication to the Hegemony and his loyalty.

Throughout the event, no one dares to mention how the information leading to his remains was obtained. It’s an unspoken agreement, a shared understanding that some truths are best left unspoken.

A banquet follows the ceremony, transforming the somber atmosphere into one of camaraderie and celebration. The clinking of glasses, the low hum of music, and the laughter of nobles fill the air. Stories are shared, toasts are made, and bonds between houses are reaffirmed. The event becomes as much about the living as it is about honoring the dead.",hegtales_Quest3_ReturnRet9:Continue,
