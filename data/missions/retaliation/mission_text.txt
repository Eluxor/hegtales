Location: In orbit around Sindria in the Askonia System.
Date: 181.XX.XX

Opis is gone. Admiral Andrada, Hero of the Hegemony, despite direct orders from the Hegemony Executive Council to return to the core for debriefing, Andrada has ignored all communications. Instead, he has turned the majority of the Hegemony intervention fleet in Askonia into his personal armada, cementing his dominion over the system.

The Hegemony Executive Council, now fractured and politically paralyzed, has no immediate means to respond. Their other fleets are too far away, and reinforcements cannot arrive in time to prevent Askonia from falling entirely under Andrada’s rule.

Admiral Christian Ossum, the sole remaining high-ranking Hegemony official in the system as he was an observer of the whole ordeal, stands as the last hope for restoring order. Operating from the HSS Retaliation, Ossum faces an impossible task:

To eliminate Andrada and dismantle his burgeoning dictatorship before Askonia is lost forever.

House Ossum stands alone, against the might of the Hegemony Navy.
